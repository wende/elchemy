# Introduction


Elchemy is a set of tools and frameworks, designed to provide a language and an environment
as close to [Elm programming language](http://elm-lang.org) as possible, to build server applications
in a DSL-like manner for Erlang VM platform, with a readable and efficient Elixir code as an output.

## Features

Elchemy inherits many values from its parents: Elm and Elixir

### Elm
- ML like syntax maximizing expressiveness with additional readability and simplicity constraints
- Static typing with type inference
- Beautiful compilation errors
- Tagged union types and type aliases with type parameters (aka generic types)
- All functions are curried by default
- [No typeclasses](http://www.haskellforall.com/2012/05/scrap-your-type-classes.html)

### Erlang/Elixir
- Documentation as a first class citizen
- Doc tests
- Battle-tested distribution system that just works

### Additional
- Foreign function calls type safety
- Foreign function calls purity checks
- Dependency system based on GitHub
- Compile time code optimizations
